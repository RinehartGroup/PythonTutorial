    "# Object Oriented Programming and Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many good resources which provide an introduction to object oriented programming. This tutorial won't provide a comprehensive introduction and will assume some prior knowledge. [Here's a good starting point.](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/)\n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in using object oriented programming because it lets use represent things that we are familiar with in code. For example, concrete things like data files can be represented as classes. Classes let us group together data and functions that operate on the data; when we are working with the data in a notebook, we can then create as many objects of a class as there are data files, for example. We can also represent more abstract things, like datasets or models, as classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that [there are several different programming paradigms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-programming-paradigms/). We'll likely stick to object oriented and functional programming, but there aren't hard rules for when to use one or the other, and within a single project you may find yourself using both.\n",
    "\n",
    "### An update on the bug\n",
    "\n",
    "The bug discussed in the previous tutorial arises again here, this time affecting our ability to read the header (technically the same issue existed in the last tutorial but we weren't using any info within the header). For some reason, .dat files are sometimes comma separated and sometimes space separated. I think Excel is to blame (that is, if you open a .dat file in Excel and save it, it will be comma separated). We'll need to update our code to handle both cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions for reading both headers and data sections now account for this difference."

    "Standard Python classes typically start with an `__init__()` function, which is called when an object of the class is created. Class attributes (variables that are attached to the classes) are typically defined here. The `self` argument is required for all class functions and attributes. It is a reference to the object itself, and is used to access attributes and functions of the class. The [linked Real Python article](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/) gives a good explanation of `self` and how it is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "An outline of the `DatFile` class has been given in the following cell. The `__init__()` function contains attribute definitions, where the values of the attributes are determined by various functions within the class. This is a good pattern for keeping the `__init__()` function readable -- instead of writing out the code to determine the attribute values, we can just call the functions that do that work. The functions will be defined later in the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several functions have already been written. Most of these are adapted from previous tutorials. Take note of the differences when used in classes -- for example, `_get_comments()` no longer needs a `file` argument, since the `self` argument gives it access to the `local_path` attribute found withing the `DatFile` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "A note on style: the functions `_get_comments()`, `_get_header()`, and `_get_data()` are prefixed with an underscore. This is a convention that indicates that the function is intended to be used only within the class. It is not enforced by Python, but is a good practice to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the function definitions for `_determine_length()`, `_determine_hash()`, and `_get_date_created()` are single lines with the word `pass`. The `pass` keyword is used as a placeholder for code that will be written later. In this case, it's useful because we generally know what we want to do within the `__init__()` method but we need the class to have partial functionality while we write the rest of it. For example, you'll need access to the `local_path` and `header` attributes when writing those functions, and it's helpful to have a functioning partially defined class to work with while writing the rest of the class."

    "Two important concepts in object-oriented programming are [inheritance and composition](https://realpython.com/inheritance-composition-python/). Composition is perhaps easier to understand, and what we'll be using here. The `Dataset` class will be composed of `DatFile` objects -- that is, the `Dataset.files` attribute will be a list of `DatFile` objects. The `Dataset` class will have its own attributes and functions, but it will also have access to all of the attributes and functions of the `DatFile` class. Here's [a more advanced discussion of composition and inheritance](https://youtu.be/0mcP8ZpUR38), and why composition is generally preferred when possible to make code more flexible.\n",

It is placed in the class because it is very closely tied to what is going on in the class. Technically, you can call `_get_data_from_commented_file()` outside of the class, but it's unlikely that you'll need to. If the function were potentially useful outside the classs, you would define it outside the class, as we did with `label_clusters()`, `unique_values()`, `find_outlier_indices()`, and `find_temp_turnaround_point()`."

    "This information would be well-suited to a `dataclass`. Python `dataclass` objects are similar to classes, but are intended to primarily store data rather than perform operations. They have a convenient format for defining them and come with some useful built-in methods. Here's [a great intro video](https://youtu.be/CvQ7e6yUtnw) and [article](https://realpython.com/python-data-classes/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, we can define a `dataclass` using the `@dataclass` decorator (making sure to include a `from dataclasses import dataclass` at the top of the file). Defining the attributes of the class simply requires defining the name and type of the attribute. We then get `__init__()`, `__str__()`, and `__repr__()` methods for free. We can also define methods within the class as we would for a normal class."

    "Now that we have complete functions and classes, we can add documentation to them. Use the `numpy` formatting standards to add docstrings to `DatFile`, `SampleInfo`, and `Dataset`. Since these are classes, the docstrings should be added to the class definition, not the `__init__()` method. Further, because these classes only contain \"private\" methods (i.e. methods that are only used within the class), we can skip adding docstrings to those classes. Proper type hinting, meangingful variable names, and in-line commenting should be enough for those simple methods to help anyone who needs to use them.\n",
